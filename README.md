## Featured Project: Crypto Liquidity Predictor 🚀

**Project Overview**

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts cryptocurrency liquidity using recent market trends. It combines robust data preprocessing, thorough exploratory analysis, and a RandomForest regression model, exposed through an interactive Streamlit UI for exploration and live predictions.

**Tech Stack**

- Python 3.11+
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
- Joblib

**Features**

- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- RandomForest regression model with evaluation metrics
- Interactive Streamlit web interface for predictions
- Model serialization and reproducible setup
- Project reports: EDA, High-Level Design (HLD), Low-Level Design (LLD), and final summary

**Repository includes**

- Source code (data processing, model scripts, Streamlit app)
- Clear README and setup instructions
- Example datasets and serialized model (Joblib)
- Reports and documentation (EDA, HLD, LLD)

**Quick start**

1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/jayasri21072006/crypto-liquidity-predictor`
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Streamlit demo: `streamlit run app.py`
